## Project Overview
Social Graph Explorer is a Python-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project that simulates the core backend logic of a social media platform using graph data structures. It demonstrates real-world applications of algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Disjoint Set Union (DSU).

The project allows users to add people, create friendships, analyze social connections, detect communities, perform graph traversals, and generate friend recommendations. It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5.

This project was developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course.
